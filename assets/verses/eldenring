---
Fire beguiles those who gaze into it.
And so the guardians of the Flame are also its worshippers.

Arghanthy, the chief guardian of the Flame, had kept this incantation
a well-kept secret until it was stolen by Adan. The fell god still

How easy it is for learning and learnedness to be reduced to the
ravings of fanatics; all the good and the great wanted, in their
foolishness, was an absolute evil to contend with. Does such a notionb
exist in the fundamentals of Order?
---
The prophet despaired, looking up at the Erdtree, for soon the

the solitude beyond the night is better mine alone.

Forefathers, one and all...
Bear witness!

O, Death. O Destined Death...
Become my blade, once more.
---
Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:
Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings.
---
I dreamt for so long. My flesh was dull gold... and my blood, rotted.
Corpse after corpse, left in my wake. As I awaited his return.

Wait. The scarlet bloom flowers once more.
You will witness true horror. Now, rot!
---
Join the Serpent King, as family...
---
Together, we will devour the very gods!
---
O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.
Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.
Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.

Smould'ring with thy meagre flame.
Cower in fear. Of the night.

Back already?

No matter. It's all the same. Lay out your arms, then.
---
The road is yet long.
A god is not easily felled.

Could you tell me what happened?
Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?
Why does that girl weep for me?

Now, we can devour the gods, together!

NIHIL. NIHIL. NIHIL.
---
Rnnngh!
O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!
Rrrrngh!
---
Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I.
---
Oh, you... Allow me some time.
Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed.
