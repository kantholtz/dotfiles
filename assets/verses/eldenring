Then she met the full moon—and, in time, the astrologer became a queen.

Fingers cannot speak, yet these were eloquent.
Persistently did they wriggle, spelling out mysteries in the air.
Thus did we gain the words. The words of our faith.

The heart sings when one draws close to death,
and a glorious end awaits those who cling so tenaciously to life.

As the husband of Rennala of Caria, the red-haired Radagon studied sorcery,
and as the husband of Queen Marika, he studied incantations.
Thus did the hero aspire to be complete.

the Erdtree, would protect their lord as a wall of living rock.
And so it is that the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protections.
---
A vestige of the crucible of primordial life.
Born partially of devolution, it was considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times,
but is now increasingly disdained as an impurity as civilization has advanced.

The heart sings when one draws close to death,
and thus does one cling so tenaciously to life —

Malenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon,
and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.

During the age of the Erdtree, Carian astrology withered on the vine.
The fate once writ in the night skies had been fettered by the Golden Order.

allowing Rykard to challenge Maliketh the Black Blade, the black beast of Destined Death.
---
On the night of the dire plot the stolen Rune of Death enabled the first Death of a demigod.
Later, the Rune of Death spread across the Lands Between through the underground roots of the Greattree,
sprouting in the form of Deathroot.

Use to be granted audience with Mohg. Only, it is not yet time. For Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity.
Be patient. The new dynasty is nigh.

Fire beguiles those who gaze into it.
And so the guardians of the Flame are also its worshippers.

Arghanthy, the chief guardian of the Flame, had kept this incantation
a well-kept secret until it was stolen by Adan. The fell god still

In the beginning, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.
But through countless victories in war, it became the embodiment of Order.

And yet, the young Miquella abandoned fundamentalism,
for it could do nothing to treat Malenia's accursed rot.
This was the beginning of unalloyed gold.
---
The fundamentalists describe the Golden Order through the powers of

is the connections that form the relationships of all things.

How easy it is for learning and learnedness to be reduced to the
ravings of fanatics; all the good and the great wanted, in their
foolishness, was an absolute evil to contend with. Does such a notionb
exist in the fundamentals of Order?
---
The prophet despaired, looking up at the Erdtree, for soon the

the solitude beyond the night is better mine alone.
---
My apprentice, do you think it distasteful?
