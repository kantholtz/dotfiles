Wenn ich, Aguirre, will, dass die Vögel tot von den Bäumen fallen,
Dann fallen die Vögel tot von den Bäumen herunter.
Ich bin der Zorn Gottes, die Erde über die ich gehe sieht mich und bebt!
---
Lasciate ogne speranza,
voi ch'intrate
---
Let me say this about Harry Potter:
Warlocks are enemies of God!
---
Maledictus
Donum Libas
Inficimur
---
Denn alles Fleisch
es ist wie Gras
---
To stop looking for signs in the constellations
---
Curiosity killed the cat
I would rather go blind
---
Your heart will explode.
---
Stay safe friend.
Don't you dare go hollow.
---
And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.
---
Tis only the flame,
quivering at misguided Ash.
---
Rise if you would...
For that is our curse.
---
Ahh, is this the blood?
The blood of the dark soul?
---
But then there was fire
And with fire came disparity
---
The fire fades and the lords go without thrones
---
Try finger, but hole.
---
Verschwinde zwischen Schilfinseln
und schwimmenden Spinnen
im schimmernden Wasser
---
Most glorious and holy light
Bow before unending night
---
The teeth of seven thousand men
Adorn my silver crown
---
Ich tötete Mufasa.
---
And who are you, the proud lord said,
that I must bow so low?
---
Hold the door!
---
Brought forth by ancient whisper.
Deployed by inverse suns.
---
Wissen ist Nacht.
---
Over the mountain
Watching the watcher
---
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
---
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
---
Erst grübeln
Dann dübeln
---
Soft and gentle as her heart
Keep here your watch and never part
---
What power art thou, who from below
Hast made me rise, unwillingly and slow
---
The first rule of business
Protect your investment
---
I have seen your heart and it is mine
---
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
---
Desert Legion Smoke-Covenant is complete
Herb bales retied on to backs of beasts
---
Follow the smoke
Towards the riff-filled land
---
Daheim verblasst
Die Welt rückt nah
---
The way is shut
It was made by those who are dead
And the dead keep it
---
Mist and shadow
Cloud and shade
---
Man ammen toltha
I dann hen morn
---
Who brings to us
This which has stood in the darkness
---
A king he was on carven throne
In many-pillared halls of stone
---
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
---
Where once was light
Now darkness falls
---
Redness in the east beyond the mountain
The Wheel begins to turn anew
---
Blood runs from the flank of a wounded stag
Turning inwards, all beings bow low
---
Sleeping on a wire, sleeping on a lie
In your bed on fire
---
Halb Mensch, halb Couch
Vom TV kalt angestrahlt
---
What is this that stands before me?
---
But it hasn't felt like something
A touch into the void
---
Montagmorgen Hallo
Ich mach meinen Kontrollgang
---
Wir weinen, wenn ein Vogel singt
Aber nicht wenn ein Fisch blutet
Gesegnet sind die, die eine Stimme haben
---
The fires that swallow up the silent mountains are yours
---
The floods that drown the deserts and the valleys are yours
---
